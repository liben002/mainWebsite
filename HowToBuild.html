			<h1>HOW TO BUILD</h1>
			<p>This page goes over the process of building a computer</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Materials</h2>
		<p>There aren't many things you need to start building a computer, and in fact most of these are optional. The only required items are a phillips head screwdriver and an anti-static work space. Magnetic parts tray, anti-static wrist strap, and wire cutters are optional.
		</p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<h2>Before You Begin</h2>
		<p>Before you begin building, you will need a big empty space MADE OF A NON CONDUCTIVE MATERIAL. This is because static electricity will completely destroy your components. When your are building, make sure you discharge static electricity often by touching either your computer case or another big metal object that does not make contact with your parts. 
		</p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<h2>CPU, RAM, and CPU Fan</h2>

		<p> First get the CPU and line it up with the CPU slot on the motherboard. Drop it in and put the cover on top and push the handle down into the handle slot. Insert the RAM into the motherboard in the appropriate slots. If you are using dual-channel RAM put them in slots 2 and 4. They should be black. Put some thermal paste onto the CPU then place the fan on top and secure it into place following the directions in the box.
		</p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<h2>GPU and Other PCI Cards</h2>

		<p>Put all cards into the PCI slots and screw them in into the case. Make sure that the GPU goes into the top slot as that is where it will be the fastest. Make sure you have ample space between the cards. If you are using multiple GPUs connect them using an SLI bridge.
		</p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<h2>Storage, Fans, and Power Supply</h2>
		<p>Place any storage devices into their holders in the case. Screw them in tightly. Place the power supply in the case and connect all the cords to their respective places. Make sure you hear a click to know that it is in. Screw any fans into the case and connect them to the motherboard fan slots. Connect any data cords and led lights if you have them.
		</p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<p>Connect your cables to your monitor and turn on your computer. Make sure you have an Operating System to start your computer into boot mode. Congratulations, you have set up your computer.

			<h2>Information about the website</h2>
			<h3>October 23, 2017</h3>
			<p>I've redacted my name and some other things, so hopefully this website won't show up in a Google search. Will put everything back on March 1st. I'll probably put this up on Github too if possible.
			</p>
			<h3>October 15, 2017</h3>
			<p>Yeah, there's no way I'm going to have time to continue this website. I will most likely be creating another one to enter into the [redacted] competition, will link when it's up.
			</p>
			<h3>September 6, 2017</h3>
			<p>Analytics of the website say that there are an average of 25 visits to this website each month. Hello google bots. To any real people who are visiting, I'm dropping this website for the time being. I don't have the time to continue building upon it but will still keep it up. Cya until probably 2018.

			<p>Hi! Welcome to my website. Unfortunately as of right now it is currently being updated with a whole new refresh in both content and design. The goal of the website is to teach others about the things inside of a computer as well as the process of building a computer. This website won the [redacted] contest. Most, if not none of the images are owned by me because I am not a good photographer or graphic designer. Sorry. Thanks for stopping by.

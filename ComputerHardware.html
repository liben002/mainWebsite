			<h2>GPU</h2>
			<p>The Graphics Processing Unit, also known as the GPU, is typically the most expensive part of a computer build. The actual pcb part of the GPU is made by either Nvidia or Radeon, a sub-company of AMD. The cooling unit part of the GPU can be made by a multitude of companies including MSI, EVGA, Zotec, RFX, Acer, and Asus. Founder Edition GPUs are GPUs that have a cooler made by either Nvidia or AMD. There are two main types of GPU coolers, rear exhaust and blower style. Founder Edition GPUs are rear exhaust cards, which mean that they take air in from the top of the card and exhaust everything directly out of the case. This makes them very well suited for small form factor builds where airflow and temperatures are super important. The much more popular blower style cards take air in through the top and exhaust from all sides into the case. GPUs are usually available in sets of 4 or 5 iterations each time they are released. Modern GPUs that end in "80" are high end but very expensive. Similar to their CPUs, AMD GPUs are marketed for midrange affordability. The most expensive AMD GPU in the newest release, the RX580, only costs $250 while Nvidia, like Intel, markets toward expensive high end items. Nvidia's latest release, the GTX1080ti, costs upwards of $600. Nvidia also offers very high end GPUs that are usually used for taxing video editing and running games in 4K. These are typically called Titans and Quadros. The newest Nvidia Quadro card costs $4000. AMD is planning a release of new cards with the Vega architecture. These have not been released yet but should definitely be considered as they are predicted to outperform the latest Nvidia cards.

			<h2>Overclocking</h2>
			<p>It is possible to over clock both your CPU and your GPU, however they must be overclock compatible. For Intel CPUs, this means that it must be a K-series processor and the motherboard must be either X or Z series. All AMD CPUs are overclockable. Overclocking makes your CPU work faster and harder at an expense of higher power draw and higher temperatures. CPU Overclocking is done in BIOS/UEFI, which is kind of like software included in your motherboard. Overclocking your GPU is also possible and can be done using software available from the maker of your GPU. Overclocking will void your warranty and not every CPU/GPU will be able to be overclocked to the same frequency. This is because of how they are made and thus why the "Silicon Lottery" exists.

		<div class="RAM">
			<h2>RAM</h2>
			<p>RAM, or Random Access Memory, is the short term memory for the computer. When you use your computer, the tabs you have open along with any programs are stored on your RAM sticks. RAM is very quick and very useful. Unfortunately you can't replace your hard drive for RAM. This is because RAM wipes any data it has whenever you shut off your computer. There is a way, nevertheless, to convert some of your RAM to drive storage. This is only useful if you have a large amount of RAM, otherwise it is better to just get a SSD. RAM sticks come in packs of 1, 2, or 4, and most motherboards can only hold up to 32 GB. Most consumer motherboards utilize dual-channel technology, which is like a free speed upgrade. For example, if you want to have 16 GB of RAM and your computer can utilize dual-channel, then it it better to get 2 8 GB sticks rather than a single 16 GB stick, because the speed will be faster. There are many RAM manufacturers, however the actual speed of the RAM doesn't usually change with different companies, so when buying find a reliable company that you have a good history with and buy from them. RAM comes in iterations called DDRX, where X is a number that represents the generation and DDR stands for Double Data Rate. RAM is not backwards compatible and should be bought carefully. They current generation of RAM is DDR4. This is a type of RAM used in GPUs called GDDR RAM. It is similar to the regular kind but is in it's 5th generation.

		<div class="MOBO">
			<h2>Motherboard</h2>
			<p>The motherboard is that flat rectangular board that everything connects to. It houses the CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and any other PCI cards you have(like wifi or bluetooth cards). Motherboards have big metal chunks coming out of them called heatsinks. These draw the heat from the motherboard and allows it to disperse into the computer case to keep your parts cool. They also connect to the case fans and will support up to 5 typically. On top of the CPU is another heatsink that connects to its personal fan because CPUs heat up very quickly. There are a few sizes of motherboards, which go higher in price each size up. 
			</p>
		</div>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<div class="STORAGE">
			<h2>Storage</h2>
		 	<p>There used to be only 1 main type of long term storage for your data, however in recent years 3 more types became popular. The original device was the Hard Drive. These are big rectangular pieces that can hold above 10TB of data. They are usually manufactured by Western Digital(WD) or Seagate. They are mechanical, meaning that they have physical moving parts. Because of this they tend to fail often and require constant backups if you store important data. These are very inexpensive. A 1TB hard drive will cost only ~$50. The next tier is the Solid State Drive(SS). These are very popular as they are fast, affordable, and are reliable. They are completely electrical, so they will not fail physically. This means it is much safer to store data on. They are also smaller and sleeker than hard drives, however they cannot store as much data. Any size above 1TB is going to cost a good deal of money. Next is the PCI-E slot storage card. These are usually sold by intel and are higher end. They only come in small sizes but connect to your motherboard directly, unlike SSDs and hard drives, which need both a data cable and a power cable. The highest, newest, smallest type of storage is the M.2 slot storage card. These are very small and cost quite a bit. They actually tie in price and tier with PCI-E cards but are much more aesthetically pleasing. These also connect to the motherboard directly.

		<div class="PSU">
			<h2>Power Supply</h2>
			<p>Power supplies provide power to all the parts of your computer. These usually come in 300, 400, 430, 500, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, or 1500 watt iterations, however for most people 600 will be the most they will need. When purchasing a  power supply, it is very important to choose a reliably company as a bad power supply will fail and may even cause your other parts to fail. These also come in regular, semi-module, and module types. Module power supplies allow you to custom choose which power connectors are actively connected. These tend to be more expensive. Semi-modules have some connectors that can be taken off and regulars have none.

			<div class="COOLING">
			<h2>CPU Cooling</h2>
			<p>There are 3 types of CPU cooling, stock, air, and water cooling. Stock cooling is the fan and heatsink that comes with your CPU. It is usually very small and only suitable when not overclocking, however it can also handle slight overclocks if you don't care about a small temperature increase. Air cooling is the most popular type of cooling for overclocked cards. They are similar to stock coolers but have bigger heatsinks and stronger fans. Heatsinks are usually cut into fin shapes so that they have the maximum amount of surface area available to give off air from. Air coolers are pretty cheap and work well. Water cooling comes in two forms, All-in-ones, also called AIOs, and custom loops. These are very similar with the only difference being that AIOs are prebuilt and custom loops need to be set up. The way water coolers work is that heat from the CPU is transferred to a metal block that has a constant water source attached to it. The water takes the heat and pushes it to a radiator connected to a fan that then pushes the heat out of the case. Water cooling is much more expensive than air coolers but look very nice, especially in a tempered-glass windowed case.

		<div class="CASE">
			<h2>Case</h2>
			<p>The computer case is the first thing people will notice when they see your computer. These range from $50 to upwards of hundreds of dollars. $50 cases tend to just be blocks of metal that look plain. Higher end cases can have aluminum brush finishes and tempered glass windows. The best looking cases tend to be made by NZXT and Corsair.

			<h2>CPU</h2>
				<p>The brain of the computer is the Central Processing Unit, also known as the CPU. CPUs take all the information being sent from your components, processes it, and transfers it to your monitor. They are small square shaped blocks that have a metal lid on top and either have many small plates of gold, in the case of Intel CPUs, or small pins, if you use AMD, on the bottom. They are manfactured by those two main companies, Intel and AMD. Intel makes high end but expensive models of CPUs while AMD usually focuses more on affordable and "good-enough" models, however, with the new AMD Ryzen chips, you can get top-tier performance for about half the price as those of Intel's lineup. These should be the only AMD CPUs you buy as every other model is over 5 years old. Modern desktop CPUs come in 3 main variants. Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 for Intel and Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, and Ryzen 7 for AMD. Core i3 CPUs are the lower end of the variants. They tend to have only 2 cores, don't consume loads of power, and can cost anywhere from $100-$150. The next level is Core i5. These are midrange chips that have 4 cores. They are the sweet spot for gaming and light editing and typically sell for $150-$230. The highest consumer tier of Intel processors is the Core i7. These can be as expensive as $1000 and contain either 4, 6, or 8 cores. If the most intensive thing you will use your computer for is gaming, an i5 is all you need. More cores will not make your games run smoother. Core i7s are used for video editing and 3d modeling. You should never buy based on company, but rather based on what you need. AMD's Ryzen chips follow the same format for the most part, just with different prices and cores. Some Intel processors advertise a thing called "hyperthreading", which means that each core simulates two cores, for example if a CPU has 4 cores and hyperthreading, it simulates a total of 8 cores. Additionally, new product hype tends to be misleading so when upgrading make sure to wait for user benchmarks before buying the it can newest models.

		<p>This page is not a definitive guide on which companies make the best products but rather whether or not they are reliable or have a good business model in my and other consumer's personal experiences. Your mileage may vary.<p>
		<h2>CPU</h2>
		<p>When buying a CPU, make sure that it fits what you want to do with it. For example, if you will be overclocking it you will be better off with an Intel K-series CPU. K-series CPU tend to be more expensive than their counterparts but allow for overclocking. Another thing to keep in mind is that the overclockability of each CPU varies. You may get one that will only push 0.1 GHz above normal or one that can manage 2.0 GHz above normal. Until AMD Zen series is released, buying an AMD CPU will not be any better than buying an Intel one at the same price range. even AMD's most recent CPU release is almost 4 years old. Additionally, buying the latest generation Intel CPU will not necessarily give a better money spent to performance ratio than an older generation.
		</p>
		<h2>GPU</h2>
		<p>When buying a GPU, the first step is knowing how much you are willing to spend. The most used measurement for GPU value is the amount of frames you get for each dollar. A $100 GPU that only pushes 10 frames will not be as good of a value as getting a $200 GPU that gives you 130 frames. Similarly a $1000 GPU that gives you 200 frames is also not worth it. For AMD, the sweet spot is anywhere from $190-$250. For Nvidia you will want to go a little higher. Now that you know what GPU you want it is time to think about what external cooler you wish to have for your GPU. There are 2 main types of GPU coolers. Blower style fans and external exhaust. Blower style fan GPUs will blow hot air 	into your case at a fast rate while external exhaust will blow hot air out of the case but at a much lower speed. There are also multiple companies that manufacture GPU coolers. The company that has the best customer service and businness model is EVGA. They actively participate in the enthusiest community and will often bend over backwards to help you with any troubleshooting. On the other hand, many people have had problems with Asus and Acer purposely damaging GPUs sent in for repair along with hosting fake giveaways. These companies should be avoided if possible. Zotac, MSI, and RFX are in the middle, with RFX being slightly better than the other two.

		<h2>RAM</h2>
		<p>RAM speed doesn't tend to vary between companies and are cheap enough that if they fail, you will be fine with purchasing another set. Find a company you have had a good experience with and buy from them. I recommend Kingston or Corsair because their RAM shrouds also look amazing. 
		</p>
		<h2>Storage</h2>
		<p>When purchasing a hard drive, it doesn't matter who you buy it from as long as you perform frequent backups. They are inexpensive and in large supply. When buying an SSD, M.2 SSD, or PCIE SSD, make sure you only buy from reputable companies like Kingston, ADATA, Intel, and Samsung. They use better quality materials and also provide generally good customer service. Stay away from SSDs that are very cheap as they will fail often.
		</p>
		<h2>Case</h2>
		<p>Buying a case depends on how much you are willing to spend along with how much looks matter. Most are made of metal while some nice ones have a tempered glass window. NZXT and Corsair seem to be popular choices. 
		</p>
		<h2>Where to Buy</h2>
		<p>Once you decide what component you want, you will need a place to buy them from. If you want to buy from a physical store go to your nearest Microcenter or other computer hardware store. Stay away from places like Bestbuy and Walmart unless you know the exact the price you are willing to pay. If you wish to buy online Amazon and Newegg are excellent websites that are provide good customer support. Do not buy from personal retailers like ebay or craigslist as any good deal you see will be a scam. A big factor when choosing parts is the actual color of the parts. A vast majority of professional looking computers have a consistent color pattern. For example, red and black go well together, as does blue and black. Choosing popular colors will give you a larger set of products that look well together. LED lights will also brighten up your system. These are optional and the brand doesn't matter.
